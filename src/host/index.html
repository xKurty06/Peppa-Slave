This bot was made by a Filipino person, and  has a lot of useful features like <i>Anti-Link, Custom Emojis, Well designed commands, Useful commands</i> for your server, and also <i>Online 24/7</i>  and many more similar commands! I created this bot during my free time because It was my hobby, to code and build discord bots! Stitchy was built perfectly just for your server! Enjoy using Stitchy Bot.
